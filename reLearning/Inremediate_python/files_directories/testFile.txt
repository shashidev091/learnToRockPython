        Dear [name]

        I never expected to meet a man like you. You are so amazing and unique.
     I admire your voracious appetite for life, your strength and courage,
     your intelligence, your take charge, the-world-be-damned attitude.
     I admire your adventurous and energetic spirit.

        I think of you as a pioneer of sorts--enthusiastic, confident, dynamic, and quick-witted.
     Of course, at times, your immense energy makes you seem aggressive and restless,
     headstrong and quick-tempered, but I love these qualities, too, because I know that your love for life and your
     love for me are what drive you.

        In the end, I love all that which is essential to your nature.
    I love the warrior within you, and there is no one else on earth I would rather be with,
    or who I would rather give myself to, or who can make me as happy or as content with life as you do!
